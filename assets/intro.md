#### Welcome! 

I am a passionate data scientist, persistent learner, and, most importantly, a devoted friend, son, brother, and boyfriend.


As a professional data scientist working for a retail data science company in Cincinnati, OH, I have developed a robust experiential skillset working on a vast array of applied data science work. 


My deep passion for data science was fostered and stimulated through my Master's studies in Economics from Miami University in Oxford, OH and, prior to graduate school, my studies in Mathematics and Economics at the University of Dayton. 


My fields of expertise concentrate heavily in applied econometrics, mathematical optimization, statistical/machine learning, and bridging the conceptual gap between causal inference and predictive modeling. 


I write on Medium for [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/@jakepenzak).
